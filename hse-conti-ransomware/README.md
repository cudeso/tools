1. Design clinical and services continuity workarounds, informed by the Clinical and Services Impact Analysis.

1. Design workarounds to support rapid data remediation post-incident or crisis.

1. Rehearse workarounds in multi-team exercises.

1. Consider a review to establish the longer term clinical impacts of the Conti attack.

1. Ensure the Clinical and Services Impact Analysis is informed by an up-to-date asset register and configuration management database.

1. Map and document the people and technology resources and processes required to recover all critical systems in a pre-defined sequence.


# Cybersecurity Framework

1. The HSE should continue to develop an asset register that is aligned to clinical and corporate services, as well as underpinning a process to ensure the register is maintained up to date. Doing so will allow
the HSE to determine the potential impact of any future incident and effectively respond in a planned, controlled and structured manner.

1. The HSE should create a cybersecurity strategy, covering at a minimum incident detection, incident response and business recovery. It will also need to be aligned to the HSE strategy objectives and signed off by the HSE Board.

1. The HSE should establish an appropriate cybersecurity risk and governance framework to ensure there is a consistent and clear allocation of responsibility, authority, and accountability. Including the
need to establish reporting processes to ensure potential cybersecurity incidents are appropriately reported in all cases.

1. The HSE should complete its required OES returns on an annual basis to ensure compliance with NISD regulations and to understand potential cybersecurity weaknesses with critical services

1. The HSE should develop a formal cybersecurity risk framework aligned to the business’ operational risks and strategic plans

1. The HSE should implement a Third Party Risk Management framework that defines how third parties to the HSE are assessed for cybersecurity risks and what risk treatment plans are appropriate to address residual cyber risk

1. The HSE should introduce a comprehensive, formalised cybersecurity training and awareness programme that is delivered to all staff at all grades across the organisation. This should be conducted on a regular basis.

1. The HSE should introduce centralised processes and procedures to manage and review the appropriate access and identities that require access to services and data. This should be in the form of an Identity Access Management (IAM) solution that would consistently manage access across users, System Admins and third parties

1. ICT HSE should implement a structured process for performing data backups and storing this data off site. Regular testing of this data should take place to ensure success recovery. 

1. The HSE should develop a strategy for adopting the appropriate protective technologies and ensure consistent deployment across the HSE network.

1. The HSE should develop a process to maintain security baselines for all operational hardware and software, including but not limited to establishing preventative processes such as patch and vulnerability management processes.

1. The HSE should develop a cybersecurity threat profile that is informed by relevant sources to enable an effective monitoring capability. This should include threat intelligence feeds to provide an informed view of the latest cyber threats relevant to the HSE. These feeds should be used in conjunction with a SIEM to inform and provide IOCs for monitoring and detecting across the HSE ICT estate. Aligned to this the HSE should implement anti-virus consistently across the estate, ensure it as well as logging and EDR outputs are aggregated and obtain a 24x7 security operations centre (SOC) to monitor the entire business and detect anomalous behaviour and events.

1. The HSE should implement alert monitoring on all network servers, endpoint devices, and firewalls
for the external and internal networks. Specific use cases for each alert should be developed for the
chosen SIEM.
1.  The HSE should implement a holistic network detection and response functionality with a dedicated team to continually monitor for and respond to alerts.
1. The HSE should develop an appropriate cybersecurity response policy, supported by plans and/or run books for cybersecurity incidents that are regularly reviewed and exercised so that it can mount an effective and efficient response in the event of a future incident.
1. The HSE should develop a formal internal communications plan where key internal parties such as senior leadership, voluntary hospitals, CHOs are receiving timely and consistent messages. Specifically the HSE should develop specific runbooks and template responses for specific scenarios to aid a speedy response and ensure there is consistent communication
1. The HSE should ensure that an appropriate response policy, plan, and process are in place to manage multiple security incidents, perform response investigations, and collect evidence to assess the best potential mitigation plan.
1. The HSE should develop formal mitigation strategies and tactics to isolate, remove, and monitor threats. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) should be put in place so that performance can be optimised.
1. The HSE should establish a formal process, as well as resources to ensure lessons were learnt and codified from all incidents and are maintained to reflect operational and organisational change.
1. The HSE should implement a cybersecurity recovery plan that links to an asset register detailing Clinical, Corporate and other priorities and test this plan on a regular basis.
1. The HSE should develop a formal process for capturing improvements/lessons learnt following an incident.
1. The HSE should consider developing a communications strategy for cybersecurity incidents
